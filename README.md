# esp8266-obs-display
A small little project to communicate with OBS Studio and display stuff on a 16x2 LCD.
I used node-js as middleware so the esp8266 runs smoother.
(For example, volume updates would probably kill it on platformio)

# Getting started
If you want to use this project, copy all `.env.default` files and rename them to `.env` (or just rename them). Then, replace the default values and there you go!
